In this study, we simultaneously account for the interaction between legal crackdown, issue area, funding source, and managerial practices as well as donor characteristics. We hypothesize that each of these structural and organizational characteristics will have a significant effect on donor behavior, but weâ€™re unsure of the direction of that effect.

if (intercept == 1) {
  draws %>% 
    mutate(
      levels = factor(i, labels = level_labels)
    ) %>%
   # filter(levels == str_c("Issue area: ", c("Environment", "Human rights", "Refugee relief"))) %>%

```

### Relationship With Host Government

We theorize that structural characteristics like an NGOâ€™s host-country political and legal environment can serve as heuristics and shortcuts for donors. Donors who see that an NGO faces general legal trouble abroad will use that knowledge to decide whether or not to donate.

```{r relationship-with-gov, echo = FALSE}
# Plot marginals
if (intercept == 1) {
  draws %>% 
    mutate(
      levels = factor(i, labels = level_labels)
    ) %>%
    filter(levels == str_c("Relationship with host government: ", c("Criticized", "Under crackdown"))) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = Theta, y = levels)) + 
    geom_density_ridges(scale = 5, height = 1, rel_min_height = 0.01) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = "grey") +
    labs(y = "Attribute Levels")
}
if (intercept != 1) {
  draws %>% 
    filter(j != 1) %>% 
    mutate(
      levels = factor(i, labels = level_labels), 
      covariates = factor(j, labels = covariate_labels)  
    ) %>%
    filter(covariates == c("Follow national news: Multiple times a day to Never", "Follow international news: Always to Never")) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = Theta, y = covariates)) +
       geom_density_ridges(scale = 5, height = 3, rel_min_height = 0.01) +
       geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = "white") +
       labs(y = "Covariates") +
       facet_wrap(~ levels, ncol = 5)
}

```


### Organizational Characteristics

We theorize that non-structural organizational characteristics like managerial practices, funding sources, and issue area also serve as heuristics and influence donation patterns.

#### 1. Managerial Practices

```{r managerial-practices, echo = FALSE}
# Plot marginals
if (intercept == 1) {
  draws %>% 
    mutate(
      levels = factor(i, labels = level_labels)
    ) %>%
    filter(levels == c( "Financial transparency: Yes",
  "Accountability: Yes")) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = Theta, y = levels)) + 
    geom_density_ridges(scale = 5, height = 3, rel_min_height = 0.01) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = "grey") +
    labs(y = "Attribute Levels")
}
if (intercept != 1) {
  draws %>% 
    filter(j != 1) %>% 
    mutate(
      levels = factor(i, labels = level_labels), 
      covariates = factor(j, labels = covariate_labels)  
    ) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = Theta, y = covariates)) +
       geom_density_ridges(scale = 5, height = 3, rel_min_height = 0.01) +
       geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = "white") +
       labs(y = "Covariates") +
       facet_wrap(~ levels, ncol = 5)
}
```

#### 2. Funding Sources
```{r funding_sources, echo = FALSE}
# Plot marginals
if (intercept == 1) {
  draws %>% 
    mutate(
      levels = factor(i, labels = level_labels)
    ) %>%
    filter(levels ==   str_c("Funding sources: ", c("Handful of wealthy private donors", "Government grants"))) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = Theta, y = levels)) + 
    geom_density_ridges(scale = 5, height = 3, rel_min_height = 0.01) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = "grey") +
    labs(y = "Attribute Levels")
}
if (intercept != 1) {
  draws %>% 
    filter(j != 1) %>% 
    mutate(
      levels = factor(i, labels = level_labels), 
      covariates = factor(j, labels = covariate_labels)  
    ) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = Theta, y = covariates)) +
       geom_density_ridges(scale = 5, height = 3, rel_min_height = 0.01) +
       geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = "white") +
       labs(y = "Covariates") +
       facet_wrap(~ levels, ncol = 5)
}
```

#### 3. Issue Areas

```{r issue-areas, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Plot marginals
if (intercept == 1) {
  draws %>% 
    mutate(
      levels = factor(i, labels = level_labels)
    ) %>%
    filter(levels == str_c("Issue area: ", c("Environment", "Human rights", "Refugee relief"))) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = Theta, y = levels)) + 
    geom_density_ridges(scale = 5, height = 3, rel_min_height = 0.01) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = "grey") +
    labs(y = "Attribute Levels")
}
if (intercept != 1) {
  draws %>% 
    filter(j != 1) %>% 
    mutate(
      levels = factor(i, labels = level_labels), 
      covariates = factor(j, labels = covariate_labels)  
    ) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = Theta, y = covariates)) +
       geom_density_ridges(scale = 5, height = 3, rel_min_height = 0.01) +
       geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = "white") +
       labs(y = "Covariates") +
       facet_wrap(~ levels, ncol = 5)
}

```
### Organization
```{r organization, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Plot marginals
if (intercept == 1) {
  draws %>% 
    mutate(
      levels = factor(i, labels = level_labels)
    ) %>%
    filter(levels == str_c("Organization: ", c("Amnesty International", "Greenpeace", "Oxfam", "Red Cross"))) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = Theta, y = levels)) +
    geom_density_ridges(scale = 5, height = 3, rel_min_height = 0.01) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = "grey") +
    labs(y = "Attribute Levels")
}
if (intercept != 1) {
  draws %>% 
    filter(j != 1) %>% 
    mutate(
      levels = factor(i, labels = level_labels), 
      covariates = factor(j, labels = covariate_labels)
